# Snow Map
During a snowstorm, many people look at this website to "figure out" the chances that school closes the next day. 
It simply scrapes KSFY News for current cancellations and plots them on the website using the Google Maps API, so it only works for the eastern South Dakota region.

This project's claim to fame was when my principal told me he used this website to help make his decision to call out school :) 

It's hosted at https://map.samyok.us, although it only works in the deep winter months.
